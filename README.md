## Inspiration
In a company it is much easier to talk and form relationships with people that you work with than in other departments. You might not even be aware of what other departments are working on even though they are in the same company. Our website strives to make you more aware of what your company is working on and help you meet more people within it.

## What it does
Our website asks questions about your interests and tries to pair you with someone in your company from another team to learn more about what they do. 

## How we built it
We used React JS with TypeScript and SCSS.

## Challenges we ran into
Sometimes styles applied to elements we didnâ€™t want them to so we had to watch for unintended changes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to make something finished after starting over a couple of times. 

## What we learned
We sharpened our SCSS skills and learned more about how to organize components in React.

## What's next for Meeting Match
We plan on adding more questions to match people based off. As this scales, more questions can be added to further find a better match. We can also add an incentive system. For example, if you enjoy talking to someone and meet three times then the company could pay for a meal out.
